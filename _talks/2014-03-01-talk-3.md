 This talk explored the development of a novel neural network designed specifically for real-time liver ultrasound (US) image segmentation. Emphasizing the challenges posed by noisy and low-contrast ultrasound images, the presentation highlighted how the new network leverages advanced architecture, including Pyramid Scene Parsing, to deliver accurate and efficient segmentation in real-time. By addressing the clinical need for rapid and precise liver segmentation, this talk demonstrated the potential of the network to enhance diagnostic workflows and improve decision-making in liver disease management.
