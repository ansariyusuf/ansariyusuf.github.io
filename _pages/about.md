## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, specializing in the development of custom, efficient, and lightweight neural network architectures for analyzing biomedical images and signals. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and the pressing need for accessible diagnostic tools in resource-constrained settings. For more details about my academic and professional journey, you can view my [CV here](https://ansariyusuf.github.io//files/MYA_CV.pdf).

## Research

My research focuses on creating efficient and effective computational systems that make state-of-the-art diagnostic tools accessible to underdeveloped and developing regions. I aim to combat the disparity in access to advanced AI-driven technologies, which are often limited to financially robust institutions in developed countries. By designing objective tools for analyzing biomedical images, signals, and other data, I hope to enable better diagnostics, prognosis, early detection, and treatment planning for diseases like cancer and cardiovascular conditions. 

My work is particularly geared toward empowering war-torn regions, refugee camps, and non-profit organizations, where financial and infrastructural constraints limit access to such advanced systems. You can read more about my research in my [research statement](https://ansariyusuf.github.io//files/Research_statement_2pages_Generic.pdf).

## Teaching

My teaching philosophy is centered on empowering students to become independent learners. To achieve this, I emphasize a systematic approach that integrates three key aspects: understanding the intuition behind concepts, mastering their implementation, and evaluating their real-world impact. By reinforcing this cycle throughout the learning process, I aim to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills in my students.
